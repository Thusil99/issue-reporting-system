# issue-reporting-system

This is a simple project developed using react and springboot java.

To run the react application , first we need to type 'npm install' and then it will run ih the brower under the 8080 port.

In the main UI you can add an issue by clicking on the add issue button then after you will see it on the main UI.

Unfortunately some of the requirements are missing, since this is my very first react and springboot project. I have tried my best to come up with expected results.
